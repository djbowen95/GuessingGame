<h1 align="center"> ❓ Word Guessing Game ❓ </h1>
<div align="center">
  <p>This Word Guessing Game is a command-line application, where a user can input a letter to guess a word from a bank of words - similar to the classic game hangman. It is built with JavaScript and Node, with the Inquirer package. It was built from starter code that included pre-written unit tests written in Jest - my goal was to meet each of these tests by writing the minimum amount of code required to pass.</p>
  <p>The project was an assignment for the <a href="https://gist.github.com/djbowen95/2846640d520a16165b9b23db2d9e0926"><strong>University of Birmingham Full-Stack Development Coding Bootcamp</strong></a>. It was built from starter code.</p>

  `Note: this is something I had built before locally but not uploaded to GitHub. I'm in the process of rebuilding it here - as I think its a good example of what I can do with / understand about test driven development and working with unit tests. - 16/08/23.`
