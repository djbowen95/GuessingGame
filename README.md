# Guessing Game
This project is currently under construction / in the first stages of its development. It will be a command-line application that allows users to guess letters, and try to guess a popular movie title.

## Q&A
I've written a short Q&A document that outlines what this project will look like, why I've chosen to develop it, and where the source code is from. You can find the [Project Objectives Q&A here](./docs/QA.md).
