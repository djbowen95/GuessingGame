This project is going to be a simple word guessing game, and I aim to build it using TDD in Node, Express and with Jest.

Overall steps:
1. Create a command-line client that gives a hangman style output with blank spaces, and accepts user input, with a single word. (version 1)
2. Shuffle that word from a given list. (version 2)
3. Use a web-based API to select that word - possibly the pokeAPI/make the game into a pokemon guesser.
4. Create a more aesthetic interface (version 4) - possibly using ASCII art but keeping it in the command line.

If i use the ASCII art, might want to use this resource:

Can't think of a way to do this other than having a database though/wouldn't be using the API.
